# Code_Quiz
This is the Code Quiz I created for my Vandy Coding Bootcamp homework assignment 

I spent a lot of working on the look of the quiz and coming up with a witty answer for each question, 
but I ran out of time and brain power to make functions work. I will do better next time.

The code quiz can be found at https://joewills615.github.io/Code_Quiz/

This is what the code looks like when you first go to the site

If you get it right, the score increases, the background turns green and the 
right answer box is highlighted green as well

After you make it through all five questions, you are giving the option to restart
